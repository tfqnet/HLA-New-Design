<u>Important Information regarding your Participating Policy</u><br/><br/>
<u>What is Participating Policy?</u><br/><br/>
A participating policy enables you to share in the profits of a life insurance Company. Profits that are allocated to the participating policyholders are usually in the form of cash dividends.<br/>
The actual payment of this dividend are not guaranteed and can increase or decrease depending on the operating and investment results experienced by the Company.<br/>
<br/><u>What are the different types of dividends payable on my policy?</u><br/><br/>
<u>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash Dividend</u><br/>
This is a non-guaranteed dividend. Annual Cash Dividend will be declared at the end of the 1st policy year onwards. Once allocated to your policy, you have the option to:<br/>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withdraw the annual Cash Dividend;<br/>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deposit the annual Cash Dividend with the Company to accumulate with interest at such rates as may be declared by the Company from time to time. The Company will apply the Cash Dividend<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deposited towards the reduction of any premiums due but not yet paid.<br/>
<br/><u>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal Dividend</u><br/>
This is a non-guaranteed dividend which may be payable when your policy ends - upon maturity or if you choose to surrender your policy. The terminal dividend is usually designed to give policyholders a fair share of the<br/>
past operating and investment results experienced by the Company, and this can make up a significant portion of the final payout.<br/>
<br/><u>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Terminal Dividend</u><br/>
This is a non-guaranteed dividend which may be payable when your policy ends - upon death or TPD. The terminal dividend is usually designed to give policyholders a fair share of the past operating and investment results<br/>
experienced by the Company, and this can make up a significant portion of the final payout.<br/>
<br/><u>How are the dividends determined?</u><br/><br/>
These dividends are not guaranteed, and they are determined by the Company based on the operating and investment results experienced. For example, if the investments have performed well over the past year, the<br/>
Company may be able to pay a higher dividend. If the investments have performed poorly, the Company may pay a lower dividend, or it may not be able to pay a dividend at all.<br/>
<br/>The dividends paid are 'smoothed'. This means that, in years where the Company has experienced good operating and investment results, they may hold back some of the profits and use them to top up dividends in poorer<br/>
years.<br/>
This is a feature unique to participating policies. This means that a Company will try to even out the payout to policyholders when results have not been favourable. However, smoothing does not give you<br/>
complete protection against poor results.<br/>
If poor results continue over several years, the Company may have to reduce dividends to reflect the poor results.<br/><br/>
